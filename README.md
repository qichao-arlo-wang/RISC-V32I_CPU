# Current work:
  - This repository was originally part of a second-year project for students in **Electronic and Information Engineering** at **Imperial College London**.
  - For more details, refer to other branches. The [**full-rv32i-design**](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/full-rv32i-design) branch contains the final version submitted for the project.

## Joint statement

Our team successfully completed a **full RV32I design**, implementing **all base RV32I instructions** except for FENCE, ECALL/EBREAK, and CSR instructions. We carried out thorough ASM testing on the newly added instructions, implemented a **pipeline with hazard handling**, and developed **4-way and 8-way L1, L2, and L3 data and instruction caches**. Finally, we made significant efforts to deploy our design on an **FPGA**, and although we were unable to fully achieve success, we learned a great deal through the process.

Our project is mainly organized into three branches, each representing a significant milestone in our RISC-V processor design:

1. [**full-rv32i-design-single-cycle**](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/full-rv32i-design-single-cycle):
   
   This branch builds upon the foundation of Lab4. It implements a single-cycle version of the full RV32I design without including any pipelining and cache structures.

2. [**pipeline branch**](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/pipeline)：
   
   This branch focuses on the pipeline implementation. It successfully integrates all RV32I instructions with hazard handling. A conceptual [diagram](/images/pipeline_structure.jpg) is also provided for reference

3. [**full-rv32i-design branch**](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/full-rv32i-design):
   
   This branch contains the complete implementation of the full RV32I design, incorporating all the features mentioned above, including the pipeline with hazard handling, 4-way and 8-way L1, L2 and L3 instruction and data caches.

In addition to these main branches, you can also find other branches on our GitHub repository, including [lab4](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/lab4), [data_cache](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/data_cache), [data-cache-multilevel](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/data-cache-multilevel), [instr_cache](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/instr_cache) and [instr-cache-multilevel](https://github.com/arlo-wang/Group-9-RISC-V/tree/instr_cache_multilevel). Each of these branches was created to implement specific functionalities, such as data and instruction caches or to track progress from earlier stages of development.

## Quick Start

### Things to note before ANY test:

- Please makes sure that you are in the `tb` folder
- If you are testing with vBuddy, ensure that the `vbuddy.cfg` file is correctly configured and that your vBuddy is properly connected to your computer.
- For **Windows users**, you may need to run `./attach_usb.sh` to correctly set up the USB connection.

### Using the testbench

The `pdf.sh` script allows you to load different `.mem` files depending on the user input. Each command automatically configures the data memory for the PDF testbench. Refer to the testbench documentation for further details. Use the following commands to specify the desired dataset:


| Command                               | Explanation                           |
| ------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------- |
| `./doit.sh verify.cpp`                | Test all instruction implemented      |
| `./pdf.sh gaussian`                   | Loads the `gaussian.mem` dataset.     |
| `./pdf.sh noisy`                      | Loads the `noisy.mem` dataset.        |
| `./pdf.sh sine`                       | Loads the `sine.mem` dataset.         |
| `./pdf.sh triangle`                   | Loads the `triangle.mem` dataset.     |
| `./f1.sh`                             | Test the F1 lights testbench (vBuddy) |

## Working Evidence

All of our testing & working evidence are in [`test evidence`](./images/TestEvidence/) folder. PDF & F1 light vbuddly tests can be found below also.

-----

As a team, we all agree that the above table and commits do not accurately measure the contribution of team members due to the following reasons:

  1. When working together online or in person, some of us may be working together on one of the laptops, so some commits made by team members are often a combined effort of two or more members.

  2. The effort revolving around debugging is often highly overlooked - commits with simple fixes took hours / days of effort, sometimes from more than one member.

  3. Testbench building and writing played a huge role in streamlining our process, and multiple tests were written to specifically do debugging and isolate problematic parts / instructions.

  4. Writing bash scripts were a tedious process, as the members used a mix of Windows laptops and Macbooks so there were a multitude of system issues. Some programs could not be run successfully on some members' laptops.
